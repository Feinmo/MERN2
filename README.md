# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


The site uses reacy-router-dom

There are 4 sub-pages:

- DEFAULT - home - shows the weather for the current localisation
- 5-day forecast - shows the weather forecast for the current localisation
- Cities iverview - shows the weather for the chosen city
- 5-day forecast - shows the weather forecast for the chosen city
